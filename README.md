# Autoencoders with keras-core using the torch backend

This notebook illustrates the usage of [keras-core](https://keras.io/keras_core/guides/getting_started_with_keras_core/) with torch with an example of a small yet efficient autoencoder on the MNIST dataset.

It was originally run on a laptop with:
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz
- 16GB of RAM
- No discrete GPU

## Scripts and Notebook

You can find the notebook [here](./notebook/main.ipynb).

You can find also find a training script and a testing script under `./scripts/`.

## Dataset 

I used the MNIST dataset in npz format from here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramtiwari/mnist-numpy?resource=download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramtiwari/mnist-numpy?resource=download).
